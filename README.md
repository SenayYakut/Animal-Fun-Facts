# Animal-Fun-Facts

Animal-Fun-Facts is  a React project.

In this project, weâ€™ll build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

Program will display a selection of animals on the screen. User will be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not. Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As we keep clicking, user will be able to see different facts.
